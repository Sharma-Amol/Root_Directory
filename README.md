# Amol Sharma - Portfolio

## About 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am Amol, a dedicated professional with a unique blend of engineering and finance expertise.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Jabalpur Engineering College (2014) and a Master's degree in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur (2016). With around six years of experience in the construction and design industry, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

Recently, I completed eMasters in Quantitative Finance and Risk Management from IIT Kanpur (July 2024), where I discovered my passion for financial derivatives and risk management. Derivatives intrigue me due to their multifaceted nature, which allows them to function as a link between investors with varying risk appetites, offering tools for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. I aspire to become a derivatives analyst, leveraging my technical background and analytical mindset to navigate the complexities of the financial markets.

My programming skills include:
  * Feature Engineering & Data Preparation: Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL, Alteryx
  * Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
  * Microsoft Office: Excel, PowerPoint, Word

Relevant Coursework:
  * Foundation of Economics and Finance
  * Introduction to Derivative Contracts
  * Quantitative Methods in R  Python
  * Security Analysis & Portfolio Management
  * Treasury & Credit Risk Management
  * ML in Financial Modeling
  * Advanced Derivatives Contracts & Pricing
  * Blockchain Application in Finance
  * Technical Analysis in Finance
  * Advanced Financial Modeling
    
My career objective is to utilize my diverse skill set, combining my engineering background with my finance education, to transition into a financial analyst role. I am eager to tackle complex problems and contribute to innovative solutions within a data-driven organization. 

I am flexible in my career path and open to opportunities on both the buy-side and sell-side, including internships that will allow me to gain practical experience in the finance sector.
