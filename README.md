## About 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am Amol, a dedicated professional with a unique blend of engineering and finance expertise. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Jabalpur Engineering College (2014) and a Master's degree in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur (2016). With around six years of experience in the construction and design industry, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
Recently, I completed my Master's in Quantitative Finance and Risk Management from IIT Kanpur (July 2024), where I discovered my passion for financial derivatives and risk management. The versatility of derivatives as instruments for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage fascinates me, as they serve as a bridge between risk-averse and risk-seeking investors. I aspire to become a derivatives analyst, leveraging my technical background and analytical mindset to navigate the complexities of the financial markets.
I am flexible in my career path and open to opportunities on both the buy-side and sell-side, including internships that will allow me to gain practical experience in the finance sector. My programming skills include:
Feature Engineering & Data Preparation: Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL, Alteryx
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
Microsoft Office: Excel, PowerPoint, Word
My career objective is to utilize my diverse skill set, combining my engineering background with my finance education, to transition into a financial analyst role. I am eager to tackle complex problems and contribute to innovative solutions within a data-driven organization. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals in the field!
