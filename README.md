# Amol Sharma - Portfolio

## About 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Amol, a dedicated professional with a unique blend of engineering and finance expertise.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Jabalpur Engineering College (2014) and a Master's degree in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur (2016). Over six years of experience in the construction and design industry have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.

Recently, I completed an eMasters in Quantitative Finance and Risk Management from IIT Kanpur (July 2024). During this program, I discovered my passion for financial derivatives and risk management. Derivatives intrigue me due to their multifaceted nature—they serve as a crucial link between investors with varying risk appetites, offering tools for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. My goal is to become a derivatives analyst, leveraging my technical background and analytical mindset to navigate the intricacies of financial markets. Simultaneously, I remain open to diverse opportunities in financial analysis and quantitative research.

Here are my programming skills:
  * Feature Engineering & Data Preparation: NumPy, Pandas, SQL
  * Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
  * Microsoft Office: Excel, PowerPoint, Word

Relevant coursework includes:
  * Foundation of Economics and Finance
  * Introduction to Derivative Contracts
  * Quantitative Methods in R  Python
  * Security Analysis & Portfolio Management
  * Treasury & Credit Risk Management
  * ML in Financial Modeling
  * Advanced Derivatives Contracts & Pricing
  * Blockchain Application in Finance
  * Technical Analysis in Finance
  * Advanced Financial Modeling
    
My career objective is to leverage my diverse skill set—combining my engineering background with my finance education—to transition into a financial analyst role. I’m eager to tackle complex problems and contribute to innovative solutions within data-driven organizations. 

I remain flexible in my career path, open to opportunities on both the buy-side and sell-side. Internships that allow me to gain practical experience in the finance sector are also of interest.
